    "- The $u(t)^{10}$ term is added as a soft restriction. We want $u(t) \\in [0,1]$ (over 100% taxes are infeasible), but imposing hard constraints creates a KKT problem which is difficult to solve. Instead, we add $u(t)^{10}$ to our running cost to discourage values greater than 1; if $|u(t)| > 1$, the cost value will be very large, but if $|u(t)| < 1$, $u(t)^{10}$ will approach 0.\n",
